# NW - CV Builder App

## Goal

Create a live-update resume that includes the following:

- A section to add general information like name, email, phone number.
- A section to add your educational experience (school name, title of study, date of study)
- A section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main tasks of your jobs, date from and until when you worked for that company)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
